# The Person Index Challenge: Extraction of Persons from Messy, Short Texts

When persons are mentioned in texts with their first name, last name and/or middle names, there can be a high variation which of their names are used, how their names are ordered and if their names are abbreviated.
If multiple persons are mentioned consecutively in very different ways, especially short texts can be perceived as "messy".
Once ambiguous names occur, associations to persons may not be inferred correctly.
We define a person index as a structured table that distinctly catalogs individuals by their names.
This code includes:
* a procedure to generate ground truth data for future evaluations.
* a baseline approach.
* evaluation strategy to test the performance of the baseline and suggest further improvements.
